# Artifacts

This repository contains artifacts for the paper: **"Cracks in the Armor: Understanding and Uncovering Cryptographic Defects in Ethereum Smart Contracts"**

It contains the source code of CrySol, datasets collected for analysis and experiment, and the results of the experiments.

Specifically, it includes the following content:

* [`./CrySol/`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/CrySol): the source code of CrySol, a fuzzing-based tool designed to detect cryptographic defects in Ethereum smart contracts.  Please refer to [`./CrySol/README.md`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/CrySol#readme) for detailed instructions on installation and usage.
* [`./Dataset/`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/Dataset): dataset collected for analysis and experiment. Please refer to [`./Dataset/README.md`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/Dataset#readme)  for detailed information.
* [`./Experiments/`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/Experiments): the results of the experiments. For detailed information on the results and instructions to replicate the experiments, please see the  [`./Experiments/README.md`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/Experiments#readme) file.
